** Background **

This project provides an Objective-C implementation of HexLib, as detailed by Red Blob Games at:

http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/ and
http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html

Whilst it started out as a relatively close port of the algorithms provided there, I did change things a bit.

I did tweak things bit to get this working on SpriteKit, and I admit that I focused primarily on hexagonal maps for World of Hex.  The rectangular, triangle and parallelogram maps are supported, though perhaps not as polished.

The project will run as is, simply displaying a map of hexes using the specified configuration/layout.
